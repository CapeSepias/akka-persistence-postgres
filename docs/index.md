![Akka Persistence Postgres](assets/project-logo.png)

The Akka Persistence Postgres plugin allows for using Postgres database as backend for [Akka Persistence](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence.html) and [Akka Persistence Query](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence-query.html).

akka-persistence-postgres writes journal and snapshot entries to a configured PostgreSQL store. It implements the full akka-persistence-query API and is therefore very useful for implementing DDD-style application models using Akka and Scala for creating reactive applications.

Itâ€™s been originally created as a fork of [Akka Persistence JDBC plugin](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-jdbc) 4.0.0, focused on PostgreSQL features such as partitions, arrays, BRIN indexes and others. Many parts of this doc have been adopted from the original [project page](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-jdbc/4.0.0/index.html).

The main goal is to keep index size and memory consumption on a moderate level while being able to cope with an increasing data volume.
